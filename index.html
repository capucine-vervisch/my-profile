		<h2>Creation🎨</h2>
		<img src="images/jewel.png" alt="My jewel" class="img-square">
		<P>
		I have created my own jewel in an artisanal studio. It's made of brass and I was inspired by the "Art Nouveau" style. I'm very proud of my creation because I would like to work in the jewelery sector later.

		<h2>Experience📝</h2>
		<img src="images/Lucky-Nugget-Saloon.jpg" alt="Lucky Nugget Saloon" class="img-square">
		<p>
		I worked at Disneyland Paris as a waitress at the Lucky Nugget Restaurant during the Christmas Holidays and I will work again here during the summer holidays. I love this job because I met a lot of people from all over the world. It's very sporty but especially very much rewarding.

		<p>
			I have already discovered Portugal, Switzerland and Venise. My three previous travels were amazing because I'm very curious and I love discovering new things. Soon, I will travel around Finland as an exchange student during my second year of Bachelor.
